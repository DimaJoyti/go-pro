### Phase 7: Specialized Examples
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**TODO:**
1. Move advanced examples to `cmd/examples/advanced/`
2. Fix JSON parser User struct
3. Combine order.go and orders.go
4. Update all examples to use new utilities

**Source Files to Migrate:**
- `json_parser.go` → `cmd/examples/advanced/json_demo.go`
- `weather.go` → `cmd/examples/advanced/weather_demo.go`
- `word_counter.go` → `cmd/examples/advanced/wordcount_demo.go`
- `order.go` + `orders.go` → `cmd/examples/advanced/orders_demo.go`
- `fib.go` → `cmd/examples/advanced/fibonacci_demo.go`

**Key Fixes:**
- Complete User struct in json_parser.go
- Merge order.go and orders.go properly
- Replace `string.repeat()` with `strings.Repeat()`
- Fix all `main()` conflicts

### Phase 8: Cleanup & Documentation
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**TODO:**
1. Remove all old files from root `fun/` directory
2. Update all imports across the codebase
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Add benchmarks for all algorithms
5. Update README with usage examples
6. Create CONTRIBUTING.md
7. Add CI/CD configuration (optional)

**Cleanup Tasks:**
- Delete all `.go` files from `basic/examples/fun/` root
- Keep only: `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- Verify all imports are correct
- Run `go test ./...` to ensure all tests pass
- Run `go build ./...` to ensure all code compiles

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Completed Tests:
- ✅ Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
- ✅ Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- ✅ Priority queue
- ✅ Linked list operations
- ✅ Benchmarks for data structures

### Needed Tests:
- ⚠️ Algorithm tests (search, sort, strings, math)
- ❌ Concurrency tests
- ❌ Cache tests
- ❌ Integration tests

## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions:
1. **Generics**: Used Go 1.18+ generics for type safety
2. **Thread Safety**: All data structures are thread-safe with RWMutex
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error types and handling throughout
4. **Documentation**: GoDoc-style comments on all public APIs
5. **Testing**: Table-driven tests and benchmarks

### Known Issues:
1. `weekPointers.go` requires Go 1.24 (weak pointers)
2. Multiple `main()` function conflicts in old files
3. `string.repeat()` method errors (use `strings.Repeat()`)
4. Some function name conflicts (`sum`, `processData`, `User`)

### Performance Notes:
- Stack operations: O(1) amortized
- Queue operations: O(n) for dequeue (slice reallocation)
- Binary search: O(log n)
- Merge sort: O(n log n)
- Concurrent merge sort: Faster for large datasets (>1000 elements)
