## 📖 Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows this pattern:

```
course/
├── lessons/lesson-XX/
│   └── README.md          # Theory and explanations
└── code/lesson-XX/
    ├── main.go            # Runnable examples
    ├── exercises/         # Your practice code
    │   ├── *.go          # Exercise files
    │   └── *_test.go     # Test files
    └── solutions/         # Reference solutions
```

---

## 🎯 Learning Workflow

### Step 1: Read Theory
```bash
cd course/lessons/lesson-XX
cat README.md  # or open in your editor
```

### Step 2: Run Examples
```bash
cd ../../code/lesson-XX
go run main.go
```

### Step 3: Complete Exercises
```bash
# Edit exercise files
vim exercises/exercise_name.go  # or use your preferred editor

# Run specific test
go test -v ./exercises -run TestFunctionName

# Run all tests
go test -v ./exercises/...
```

### Step 4: Check Coverage
```bash
go test -v -cover ./exercises/...
```

### Step 5: Run Benchmarks (if available)
```bash
go test -bench=. ./exercises/...
```

### Step 6: Review Solutions
```bash
cat solutions/exercise_name_solution.go
```

---

## 🔧 Common Commands

### Running Code

```bash
# Run main.go
go run main.go

# Run specific file
go run path/to/file.go

# Run with race detector
go run -race main.go
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run specific test
go test -v -run TestName

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Benchmarking

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./...

# Run specific benchmark
go test -bench=BenchmarkName

# With memory stats
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Vet code
go vet ./...

# Run linter (if installed)
golangci-lint run
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Practice Daily
- Dedicate at least 1 hour per day
- Consistency beats intensity
- Review previous lessons regularly

### 2. Write Code, Don't Just Read
- Type out all examples yourself
- Experiment with variations
- Break things and fix them

### 3. Use the Tests
- Tests are your feedback loop
- Read test failures carefully
- Use tests to understand requirements

### 4. Read Error Messages
- Go's error messages are helpful
- Understand what the compiler is telling you
- Learn from mistakes

### 5. Explore the Standard Library
- Read package documentation
- Study standard library code
- Use `go doc` command

```bash
# View package documentation
go doc fmt
go doc fmt.Printf

# View source code
go doc -src fmt.Printf
```

### 6. Join the Community
- Ask questions on forums
- Read Go blog posts
- Follow Go developers on social media

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests Won't Run

```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd course/code/lesson-XX

# Check go.mod exists
ls go.mod

# If not, initialize module
go mod init lesson-XX

# Download dependencies
go mod tidy
```

### Import Errors

```bash
# Update dependencies
go mod tidy

# Clear module cache
go clean -modcache

# Re-download
go mod download
```

### Code Won't Compile

```bash
# Check for syntax errors
go build

# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Check for common issues
go vet ./...
```

## 🎓 Using the Learning Platform

### Start Backend API

```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
go run main.go
# API available at http://localhost:8080
```

### Start Frontend Dashboard

```bash

npm run dev
# Dashboard available at http://localhost:3000
```

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health

# Get all lessons
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/courses/1/lessons

# Get specific lesson
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/lessons/1
```
