## üìù Sample Scripts

### Video 1: Go Syntax and Basic Types

#### Introduction (2 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: GO-PRO logo and title]

Hi everyone! Welcome to GO-PRO, the complete Go programming course.
I'm [Your Name], and in this first video, we're going to learn the 
fundamentals of Go syntax and basic types.

[SCREEN: Learning objectives slide]

By the end of this video, you'll be able to:
- Set up a Go development environment
- Understand Go's basic syntax
- Work with primitive data types
- Use constants and the iota identifier

[SCREEN: Terminal]

Before we start, make sure you have Go 1.21 or higher installed.
Let's check:

$ go version
go version go1.21.0 darwin/amd64

Perfect! Let's dive in.
```

#### Theory (8 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Code editor with new file]

Every Go program starts with a package declaration. Let's create
our first Go program:

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}

[Explain each line]

- package main: This is the entry point package
- import "fmt": We're importing the format package
- func main(): This is our main function
- fmt.Println(): This prints to the console

Let's run it:

$ go run main.go
Hello, Go!

[SCREEN: Slide showing type hierarchy]

Now let's talk about Go's type system. Go has several built-in types:

1. Numeric types:
   - Integers: int, int8, int16, int32, int64
   - Unsigned: uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
   - Floating point: float32, float64

2. Other types:
   - bool: true or false
   - string: UTF-8 encoded text
   - byte: alias for uint8
   - rune: alias for int32

[SCREEN: Code editor]

Let's see these in action...
```

#### Live Coding (20 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Code editor]

Let's build a program that demonstrates all these types.

[Type slowly, explaining each line]

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Integer types
    var age int = 25
    var population int64 = 7800000000
    
    fmt.Printf("Age: %d\n", age)
    fmt.Printf("Population: %d\n", population)
    
    // Floating point
    var temperature float32 = 36.5
    var pi float64 = 3.14159265359
    
    fmt.Printf("Temperature: %.1f¬∞C\n", temperature)
    fmt.Printf("Pi: %.5f\n", pi)
    
    // Boolean
    var isActive bool = true
    fmt.Printf("Active: %t\n", isActive)
    
    // String
    var name string = "Go Programming"
    fmt.Printf("Language: %s\n", name)
}

[Run the program]

$ go run main.go

[Show output]

Great! Now let's talk about constants and iota...

[Continue with constants example]

const (
    Sunday = iota  // 0
    Monday         // 1
    Tuesday        // 2
    Wednesday      // 3
    Thursday       // 4
    Friday         // 5
    Saturday       // 6
)

[Explain iota]

iota is a special identifier that starts at 0 and increments
by 1 for each constant in the block. This is perfect for
creating enumerations.

[Show more advanced iota usage]

const (
    ReadPermission = 1 << iota  // 1 (binary: 001)
    WritePermission             // 2 (binary: 010)
    ExecutePermission           // 4 (binary: 100)
)

This uses bit shifting to create permission flags.
We can combine them with bitwise OR:

fullPermission := ReadPermission | WritePermission | ExecutePermission
// Result: 7 (binary: 111)
```

#### Exercises (5 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Exercise slide]

Now it's your turn! I've prepared several exercises for you.

Exercise 1: Create a program that:
- Declares variables of each basic type
- Performs type conversions
- Uses constants with iota

Exercise 2: Build a temperature converter that:
- Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Uses appropriate types
- Handles decimal precision

[SCREEN: Terminal showing test command]

You can check your solutions by running:

$ cd course/code/lesson-01
$ go test -v ./exercises/...

All tests should pass before moving to the next lesson.
```

#### Wrap-up (3 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Key takeaways slide]

Let's recap what we learned today:

‚úÖ Go programs start with package main
‚úÖ Every program needs a main function
‚úÖ Go has strong, static typing
‚úÖ Type conversions must be explicit
‚úÖ Constants are immutable
‚úÖ iota is perfect for enumerations

[SCREEN: Next steps slide]

In the next video, we'll dive into variables, functions,
and scope. Make sure to complete the exercises before
moving on.

### Video 9: Goroutines and Channels (Concurrency)

#### Introduction (2 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Animated goroutines visualization]

Welcome back to GO-PRO! Today we're tackling one of Go's
most powerful features: concurrency with goroutines and channels.

This is where Go really shines compared to other languages.

[SCREEN: Learning objectives]

In this video, you'll learn:
- What goroutines are and how they work
- Channel fundamentals
- How to avoid deadlocks
- Common concurrency patterns

[SCREEN: Warning slide]

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Concurrency can be tricky. We'll go slowly
and I'll show you common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
```

#### Theory (10 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Diagram comparing threads vs goroutines]

First, let's understand what makes goroutines special:

Traditional threads:
- Heavy (1-2 MB stack)
- Expensive to create
- Limited by OS

Goroutines:
- Lightweight (2 KB stack)
- Cheap to create
- Managed by Go runtime
- Can have hundreds of thousands

[SCREEN: Code editor]

Creating a goroutine is simple - just use the 'go' keyword:

go function()

That's it! The function runs concurrently.

[SCREEN: Channel diagram]

But how do goroutines communicate? That's where channels come in.

Channels are typed conduits for sending and receiving values.

ch := make(chan int)  // Create a channel
ch <- 42              // Send to channel
value := <-ch         // Receive from channel
```

#### Live Coding (25 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Code editor]

Let's build a real example. We'll create a program that
processes data concurrently.

[Start typing]

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    for job := range jobs {
        fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing job %d\n", id, job)
        time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate work
        results <- job * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    const numWorkers = 3
    const numJobs = 9
    
    jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
    results := make(chan int, numJobs)
    
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Start workers
    for w := 1; w <= numWorkers; w++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go worker(w, jobs, results, &wg)
    }
    
    // Send jobs
    for j := 1; j <= numJobs; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)
    
    // Wait and close results
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(results)
    }()
    
    // Collect results
    for result := range results {
        fmt.Printf("Result: %d\n", result)
    }
}

[Run the program]

$ go run main.go

[Show output with workers processing concurrently]

Notice how the workers process jobs concurrently!

[SCREEN: Split screen - code and diagram]

Now, let's talk about a common problem: deadlocks.

[Show deadlock example from basic/deadlock.go]

Here's what NOT to do:

func deadlock() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    ch <- 42  // This blocks forever!
    fmt.Println(<-ch)
}

Why does this deadlock? Because:
1. We try to send to an unbuffered channel
2. No goroutine is ready to receive
3. The send blocks forever

[Show solution]

func noDeadlock() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    
    go func() {
        ch <- 42  // Send in goroutine
    }()
    
    fmt.Println(<-ch)  // Receive in main
}

The key is: someone must be ready to receive!
```

#### Exercises (5 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Exercise challenges]

Your turn! Complete these exercises:

1. Build a worker pool that processes 100 jobs with 5 workers
2. Implement a pipeline with 3 stages
3. Fix the deadlock in the provided code
4. Use select to handle multiple channels

[SCREEN: Terminal]

Run the tests:

$ cd course/code/lesson-09
$ go test -v ./exercises/...

And don't forget to run with the race detector:

$ go test -race ./exercises/...

This will catch any race conditions!
```

#### Wrap-up (3 minutes)

```
[SCREEN: Key takeaways]

Concurrency key points:

‚úÖ Goroutines are cheap - use them!
‚úÖ Channels provide synchronization
‚úÖ Always close channels when done sending
‚úÖ Use WaitGroups to wait for goroutines
‚úÖ Avoid deadlocks with proper channel usage
‚úÖ Use -race flag to detect race conditions
