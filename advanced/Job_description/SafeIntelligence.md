Contribute significantly to software development on our TypeScript-based frontend systems, primarily utilizing React to craft intuitive and highly functional user interfaces.
Productize and enhance our Kubernetes-based cloud platform to ensure high-availability, scalability, and cost-efficient ML workflows.
Work proficiently across the entire stack to develop and integrate new features related to model versioning, dataset management, verification workflows, and result/metric aggregations.
Collaborate closely with our scientific and technical teams to interface with and containerize our PyTorch-based verification toolkit.
Champion an API-first development approach to deliver feature-rich, versioned interfaces that support both our TypeScript user interface and Python-based SDKs.
