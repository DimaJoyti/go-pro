## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-pro.git
cd go-pro

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DimaJoyti/go-pro.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies and set up the project
./start.sh --setup

# Or manually:
cd backend && go mod download && cd ..
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Go Code
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting
- Run `make lint` before committing
- Write meaningful comments for exported functions
- Keep functions small and focused

```bash
# Format your code
make fmt

# Run linter
make lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
make lint-fix
```

#### TypeScript/React Code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

### Testing

All code changes should include appropriate tests:

#### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific tests
cd backend
go test -v ./internal/handlers/...
```

#### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash

fix(api): correct error handling in progress endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(handlers): add tests for course handler
```

## 🎓 Adding New Lessons

### Lesson Structure
