## GO-PRO

A concise project prompt for a full-stack Golang learning platform.

### Overview
GO-PRO is a hands-on learning platform for mastering Go. It combines:
- A REST API backend written in Go for course content, exercises, and progress tracking
- A modern frontend (Next.js) for the learner experience
- A curated curriculum with lessons, exercises, and solutions you can run locally

### Goals
- Learn core Go concepts by writing and testing real code
- Explore idiomatic Go APIs and server patterns
- Practice with unit tests and simple API integrations
- Deploy a Next.js frontend (optionally to Cloudflare) to wrap the learning experience

### Repository structure (high-level)
- `backend/` — Go HTTP API (sample course data, exercises, progress)
- `frontend/` — Next.js app (React) with Cloudflare-ready config
- `course/` — Lessons, exercises, and solutions
	- `code/lesson-01/exercises` — Start here; run tests and implement
- `projects/` — Larger, end-to-end practice projects

## How to run locally

Prerequisites:
- Go 1.22+ (the server uses the new `http.ServeMux` method routing patterns)
- Node.js 18+ (Node 20+ recommended) and npm

### 1) Start the Go API

```
cd backend
go run .
```

What you get:
- API base: `http://localhost:8080`
- Health check: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health`
- Inline API docs: open `http://localhost:8080/`

Quick test (optional):
```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/courses
```

Run backend tests (if any):
```
cd backend
go test ./...
```

### 2) Start the Frontend (Next.js)

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

What you get:
- Frontend dev server: `http://localhost:3000`

Optional Cloudflare preview/deploy (requires configuration in `wrangler.jsonc`):
```
npm run preview   # build + preview via OpenNext Cloudflare
npm run deploy    # build + deploy via OpenNext Cloudflare
```

## Learn by doing

- Open `course/lessons/lesson-01/README.md` for the first lesson overview.
- Implement exercises in `course/code/lesson-01/exercises/` and run tests:
```
cd course/code/lesson-01/exercises
go test
```
- Compare your work with `course/code/lesson-01/solutions/` after you try.

---

## Roadmap (suggested next steps)
- Persist data in a real database (Postgres, SQLite, etc.) instead of in-memory
- Add user accounts and authenticated progress tracking
- Build an exercise runner that executes user code and returns results
- Expand lessons (concurrency, interfaces, generics, testing, microservices)

## Contributing
PRs and improvements to lessons, examples, and tests are welcome. Keep changes small and include a short note on why/what changed.
