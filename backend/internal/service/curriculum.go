			Description: "Learn the fundamental syntax of Go and work with basic data types including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.",
			Duration:    "3-4 hours",
			Difficulty:  domain.DifficultyBeginner,
			Phase:       "Foundations",
			Objectives: []string{
				"Set up a Go development environment",
				"Understand Go's basic syntax and program structure",
				"Work with primitive data types (int, float, string, bool)",
				"Declare and use constants",
				"Perform type conversions",
				"Use the iota identifier for enumerated constants",
			},
			Theory: `# Go Program Structure

Every Go program starts with a package declaration, followed by imports, and then the program code:

` + "```go" + `
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
` + "```" + `

## Basic Types

Go has several built-in basic types:

### Numeric Types
- **Integers**: int, int8, int16, int32, int64
- **Unsigned integers**: uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
- **Floating point**: float32, float64
- **Complex numbers**: complex64, complex128

### Other Types
- **Boolean**: bool (true or false)
- **String**: string (UTF-8 encoded)
- **Byte**: byte (alias for uint8)
- **Rune**: rune (alias for int32, represents Unicode code points)`,
			CodeExample: `package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Basic variable declarations
    var name string = "Go Programming"
    var version float64 = 1.21
    var isAwesome bool = true
    
    // Short variable declaration
    year := 2024
    
    // Constants
    const MaxUsers = 1000
    
    // Type conversion
    var x int = 42
    var y float64 = float64(x)
    
    // Print values
    fmt.Printf("Language: %s\n", name)
    fmt.Printf("Version: %.2f\n", version)
    fmt.Printf("Year: %d\n", year)
    fmt.Printf("Is Awesome: %t\n", isAwesome)
